passage = """
After your strange dinner with General Zaroff, Ivan directs you to your room. You try to sleep but you can't. Then you hear a gunshot and you get up and look out the window and down below you see the eyes of Zaroff's dogs. You go to the door and itâ€™s locked with a seven digit code lock. You look around the room and you see strange writing on the walls. You look closer and it's a secret message."""
